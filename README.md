SQRL
====

Java SQRL (Secure QR Login) implementation. 
See https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm for more information on the SQRL protocol itself.

DISCLAIMER
==========

SQRL is really early days right now and is still being flushed out. This java implementation will try to stay current with the latest developments in the SQRL protocol, but everything is subject to change as the community works to create a SQRL spec.
